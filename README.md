# Economic Freedom and Growth

This research paper is going to examine if economic freedom is conducive to growth. Specifically, it will attempt to do so by deconstructing an index of economic freedom and testing the effect of all its elements on growth. This should provide an insight into macroeconomic econometrics dealing with panel data, all the parameter identification issues that usually come along with it and possibly prove (or disprove) some theoretical assumptions. The goal is to increase my econometric toolkit, with all the results that come from it as an added knowledge bonus.

Data cleaning was performed in R, but the econometric analysis was performed in EViews.
